  <h3>Make the simulation more friendly to novices with high-fidelity modeling! </h3>
</div>

This Python-based simulation platform can realistically model various components of the UAV network, including the network layer, MAC layer and physical layer, as well as the UAV mobility model, energy model, etc. In addition, the platform can be easily extended to meet the needs of different users and develop their own protocols.

## Requiremens
- Python >= 3.3 
- Simpy >= 4.1.1
  
## Installation and usage
Firstly, download this project:
```
git clone https://github.com/ZihaoZhouSCUT/Simulation-Platform-for-UAV-network.git
```
You can even ```run main.py``` directly with one click to get a sneak peek. But we recommend that you go to ```utils/config.py``` to browse and roughly understand the simulation parameters before starting the operation, including: the size of the simulation map, the number of drones, the velocities of drones, the routing protocol adopted and so on.

## Performance test
In this section, we test the relationship between drone movement velocity and packet delivery ratio (PDR) under settings with different drone numbers in our platform. As shown in the following figure, when the GPSR routing protocol is used, the faster the drone moves, the lower the PDR. This is because the increase in speed leads to frequent changes in the topology, and there is a certain lag in the information in the neighbor table, resulting in routing Wrong choice. In addition, we can also find that increasing the number of drones can improve PDR. This is because when the node density in the network is larger, the probability of link disconnection will be reduced, so the impact of mobility on data transmission will be appropriately weakened.

## Design your own protocol
Our simulation platform can be expanded based on your research needs, including designing your own mobility model of drones (in ```mobility``` folder), mac protocol (in ```mac``` floder), routing protocol (in ```routing``` floder) and so on. It should be noted that energy model for drones is still under development. Next, we take routing protocols as an example to introduce how users can design their own algorithms.

 * Create a new package under the ```routing``` folder (Don't forget to add ```__init__.py```)
 * The main program of the routing protocol must contain the function: ```def next_hop_selection(self, packet)``` and ```def packet_reception(self, packet, src_drone_id)```
 * After confirming that the code logic is correct, add the relevant classes of the routing protocol you designed in the import part and the enumeration part of the protocol in ```config.py```.
   ```python
   # in config.py
   from routing.your_module_name.your_code_name import your_protocol_class
   
   class RoutingProtocol(Enum):
     your_protocol = your_protocol_class

     @staticmethof
     def keylist():
       return list(map(lambda c: c.name, RoutingProtocol))

   ROUTING_PROTOCOL = RoutingProtocol.your_protocol
   ```

## Contributing
Contributions, issues and feature requests are welcome! 

Currently, the energy model of UAVs (including energy consumption of flight, hovering and information transmission), calculation of physical layer SINR, etc. are still under development. Pull requests are welcomed!
